# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

project setup

1)On the homepage, popular foods are displayed. When the "Know More" button is clicked, it shows the details of that product.

2)Foods are categorized by type. When a category is clicked, it displays the foods under that category, along with an "Add to Cart" feature (temporarily only, as no backend is used).

3)An admin panel is integrated, where categories and food details can be added (this functionality is limited to the admin panel and is not connected to the frontend).

4)The cart includes options to delete items and proceed to checkout. On the checkout page, the total price of the products is displayed.
